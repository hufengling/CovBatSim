# CovBatSim

## Background
CovBatSim is a package designed to simulate some simplistic batch effects under the CovBat model. Most of the backend simulation choices have been abstracted away to increase simplicitly; however, magnitude of batch effects and magnitude of biological effects can be specified by user. Additionally, differing strength of confounding can be induced between batch and biolgy. Currently, CovBatSim is only able to simulate two batches.
